This page will be updated with full details about the final project soon! For now, we have the following two resources for you.

## Google Cloud Platform Credits

You should have received the Google Cloud Platform credits at your `@georgetown.edu` email address if you're enrolled in this course. The code in the email should add a new billing account to your Google Cloud Console, with $50 for:

* Creating a full-on Virtual Machine for the project, if you think that you'll need a bunch of storage or computing power or GPU usage, and/or
* For use with Google Maps Engine, if you think that one of their Maps Engine datasets/tools may be useful!

As mentioned in the email: A reasonable choice, which ensures that you'll stay within-budget even if you run the VM instance from now until the semester, is to create an instance (you can name it "gis-project", for example) with all of the default options except:

* Choose **ec2-small** for the Machine Type (ec2-medium is the default, but based on the estimated cost for this type, it would run out of $ before the semester ends)
* Click the "Change" button under "Boot Disk" and then set the size to **25 GB** (this is what I meant by "trying a few different options": with the $ saved moving from ec2-medium to ec2-small, you can increase from the default 10 GB disk to a 25 GB disk without the expected cost going over $50 for the semester).

## GIS Datasets/Project Ideas Collection

Once we get to the Spatial Data Science unit, I'm hoping that you will have lots of inspiration in terms of the different methods that can be used for drawing **inferences** about spatial phenomena! Until then, me and TA Billy will add links to the following [Raindrop.io collection](https://raindrop.io/jpowerj/gis-47891594){target='_blank'}, which you can browse to potentially draw inspiration for your own final project topic:
