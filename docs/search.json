As students become more comfortable with these foundations, the course will shift to a greater emphasis on applications during the second half of the semester. Particular emphasis will be placed on effective visualization of spatial data, through creation of static publication-quality maps as well as interactive maps for web applications and data dashboards.\nThe course will utilize libraries from R, Python, and JavaScript as needed, so experience using any of these languages will be helpful, but is not required. Pre-requisites (for PPOL students): PPOL 564 or PPOL 670.",

More information about reporting options and resources can be found in the Sexual Misconduct Resource Center.\nIf you would prefer to speak to someone confidentially, Georgetown has a number of fully confidential professional resources that can provide support and assistance.
