More information about reporting options and resources can be found in the Sexual Misconduct Resource Center.\nIf you would prefer to speak to someone confidentially, Georgetown has a number of fully confidential professional resources that can provide support and assistance. These resources include:\n\nHealth Education Services for Sexual Assault Response and Prevention: Confidential email sarp@georgetown.edu\nCounseling and Psychiatric Services (CAPS): 202-687-6985\n\nAfter hours you can call 833-960-3006 to reach Fonemed, a telehealth service, and ask for the on-call CAPS clinician",
