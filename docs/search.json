You can try things out or create drafts of your solutions however you’d like (for example, in VSCode or JupyterLab or any other IDE), but your final submission for each assignment must be submitted through the Google Classroom interface!\nSubmit the completed version of the assignment by clicking the blue “Hand in” button on the assignment page.\n\nThe interface allows you to unsubmit and continue working on an assignment, for example if you find a mistake, but be careful and make sure you resubmit once you’ve fixed the mistake, since submissions will not be accepted after the grace period for late submission has ended.",

Georgetown requires faculty members, unless otherwise designated as confidential, to report all disclosures of sexual misconduct to the University Title IX Coordinator or a Deputy Title IX Coordinator.\nIf you disclose an incident of sexual misconduct to a professor in or outside of the classroom (with the exception of disclosures in papers), that faculty member must report the incident to the Title IX Coordinator, or Deputy Title IX Coordinator. The coordinator will, in turn, reach out to the student to provide support, resources, and the option to meet. [Please note that the student is not required to meet with the Title IX coordinator.]. More information about reporting options and resources can be found in the Sexual Misconduct Resource Center.\nIf you would prefer to speak to someone confidentially, Georgetown has a number of fully confidential professional resources that can provide support and assistance. These resources include:\n\nHealth Education Services for Sexual Assault Response and Prevention: Confidential email sarp@georgetown.edu\nCounseling and Psychiatric Services (CAPS): 202-687-6985\n\nAfter hours you can call 833-960-3006 to reach Fonemed, a telehealth service, and ask for the on-call CAPS clinician",
