## Historical Kurdistan Geoms from ESRI

First, check out [this amazing ESRI StoryMap](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/0e0151ceb16741d992ed18edfa5f7909), which we'll cite as @hanson_putting_2023. If you're interested, you can read a bunch more about the modern history of the Kurds in @mcdowall_modern_2021.

For the sake of this assignment, though, we'll focus in on the following 1946 map, which Jeff will give the fuller details of (condensing @mcdowall_modern_2021 into less than 5 minutes, hopefully!) in class:

## From ESRI StoryMaps to `sf` Objects

Digging into the code using Developer Tools reveals the magical **API endpoint**: [https://services.arcgis.com/3xOwF6p0r7IHIjfn/arcgis/rest/services/Kurdistan1947Boundaries](https://services.arcgis.com/3xOwF6p0r7IHIjfn/arcgis/rest/services/Kurdistan1947Boundaries)

We could wrestle with ESRI's API, but, there's an even more fun way, which I learned about via [this blog post](https://jonathanchang.org/blog/downloading-esri-online-shapefiles/). Reading that will lead you on to the [`pyesridump` library](https://github.com/openaddresses/pyesridump), which I use within Python to download the layers of that StoryMap as `.geojson` files.

The remainder of the lab uses these files, along with `rnaturalearth`!

## Now Modern Border Geoms

```{r}
#| label: init
library(tidyverse) |> suppressPackageStartupMessages()
library(sf) |> suppressPackageStartupMessages()
library(rnaturalearth) |> suppressPackageStartupMessages()
library(mapview) |> suppressPackageStartupMessages()
```

```{r}
#| label: krd-countries
country_list <- c(
  "Turkey",
  "Iran",
  "Iraq",
  "Syria"
)
countries_sf <- rnaturalearth::ne_countries(
  scale=50,
  type="countries",
  country=country_list
)
```

From among allll the variables in `countries_sf`, we're only going to need `geounit`!

```{r}
#| label: simplify-countries-sf
countries_sf <- countries_sf |>
  select(geounit)
```

```{r}
countries_map <- mapview(
  countries_sf,
  zcol='geounit'
)
countries_map
```

And now the 1946 `.geojson` file, from the ESRI StoryMap, as discussed above!

```{r}
#| label: add-krd
print(getwd())
krd_sf <- sf::st_read("data/krd_46.geojson") |>
  mutate(label="Kurdistan 1946")
```

```{r}
#| label: make-krd-map
krd_map <- mapview(krd_sf, zcol='label')
krd_map
```

```{r}
#| label: display-map
countries_map + krd_map
```

## First: Splitting KRD

Intersects as the default predicate... not very helpful here!

```{r}
#| label: krd-regions
default_sf <- countries_sf[krd_sf,]
mapview(default_sf)
```

But, intersect**ion**, via `st_intersection()`, does give us what we want!

```{r}
#| label: krd-intersection
inter_sf <- st_intersection(countries_sf, krd_sf)
mapview(inter_sf)
```

## New Name Column

```{r}
inter_sf <- inter_sf |> mutate(
  krd_name = paste0(geounit, " Kurdistan")
)
```

Now let's view the four rows of the `sf` object individually:

```{r}
mapview(inter_sf[1,], zcol='krd_name')
```

```{r}
mapview(inter_sf[2,], zcol='krd_name')
```

```{r}
mapview(inter_sf[3,], zcol='krd_name')
```

```{r}
mapview(inter_sf[4,], zcol='krd_name')
```

## ...And All at Once

```{r}
mapview(inter_sf, zcol='krd_name')
```

Very cool, but, we haven't taken **population** into account at all, which was the whole point of this exercise... spatial join / interpolation time!

## Spatial Join / Interpolation

Again drawing on @mcdowall_modern_2021 (this table is on page 4), we can estimate that the overall population across the four modern countries is approximately **32 million**:

| Country | % of Country | Count |
| - |-:|:- |
| Turkey | 18 | 15 million |
| Iran | 10 | 8 million |
| Iraq | 18 | 7.2 million |
| Syria | 9 | 1.8 million |
| Diaspora and Caucasus | - | 2 million |
| **Total** | - | 34 million |

So, given this estimate, we can now "start over", this time with the goal of keeping track of the **population** as we do our operations:

```{r}
#| label: krd-with-pop
fmt_pop <- function(x) formatC(x,big.mark=",",format='d')
krd_sf <- krd_sf |> mutate(
  pop = 32000000,
  pop_str = fmt_pop(pop)
)
mapview(krd_sf, zcol='pop_str')
```

Now, if we just use `st_intersection()`... it doesn't know that it should pay attention to `pop` (even if it did know that, it wouldn't know exactly how you want to split it up... we'll get there)

```{r}
#| label: krd-naive-intersection
pop_intersected_sf <- st_intersection(countries_sf, krd_sf) |>
  mutate(
    pop_str = fmt_pop(pop),
    map_label = paste0(geounit, ' ', pop_str)
  )
mapview(pop_intersected_sf, zcol='pop', label='map_label')
```

So... what do we do? The binary operations we've learned so far won't cut it, sadly.

So, we need to cap off the binary operations portion of the class with the fanciest operation we'll need: **spatial joins**, though more specifically we'll want an **interpolation**. The function in `sf` is called `st_interpolate_aw()`.

Let's add that to our toolkit and get to **spatial statistics/data science!**

```{r}
#| label: interpolate-sf
pop_interpolated_sf <- st_interpolate_aw(
  krd_sf['pop'],
  countries_sf,
  extensive=TRUE
)
pop_interpolated_sf
```

And let's visualize it!

```{r}
#| label: interpolate-sf-mapview
pop_interpolated_sf <- pop_interpolated_sf |> mutate(
  pop_rounded = round(pop, 0),
  pop_str = fmt_pop(pop_rounded)
)
mapview(pop_interpolated_sf, zcol='pop', label='pop_str')
```

Cool, this tells us, if we **didn't** create a Kurdistan, and just drew the borders of the four states (hypothetically.......), how many Kurds would be in each country (again, **assuming *uniform* distribution across 1947 Kurdistan!**)

```{r}
pop_interpolated_sf
pop_interpolated_sf$pop |> sum() |> fmt_pop()
```

## Now Interpolating Over the *Intersection*

I think of the above as kind of a... "partially-spatially-aware" interpolation. This isn't a great description, but, what I'm getting at is the fact that:

* It *does* successfully compute how our population (of 1947 Kurdistan) proportionally distributes across the four national borders, but
* It then *represents the output*, *geometrically* (as in, the `geometry` column), as just the original four countries, now with an additional **non-spatial** property: the Kurdish population in that country

So, for what I'll call a "fully-spatially-aware" interpolation, we'll combine the two things we figured out above:

* Spatial **intersection** between 1947 Kurdistan and the four countries (producing Turkish, Iranian, Syrian, and Iraqi Kurdistan), plus
* The areal-weighted **interpolation** we just did above

And it turns out, all that we really need to change is **which `sf` object** we're spatially interpolating across! Meaning, this is the above code, copied-and-pasted, with `countries_sf` now replaced by `inter_sf`:

```{r}
#| label: fully-spatially-aware
fully_joined_sf <- st_interpolate_aw(
  krd_sf['pop'],
  inter_sf,
  extensive=TRUE
)
mapview(fully_joined_sf)
```

Also take note of something here: how did `mapview` "know" to color the four regions by population (using the viridis scheme, the default in `mapview`!), when we didn't specify anything for the `zcol` argument?

This happens because, `st_interpolate_aw()` is solely dedicated to computing a **single piece of information**: the population that results from distributing the first argument (numeric) across the second argument (an `sf`, with a `geometry` column)! It's technically not intended to carry out a full-on join.

So, if you find yourself needing to keep **all the other information** along with the new areal-weighted population (which will usually be the case), just make sure you **add the new areal-weighted population column in `fully_joined_sf`** back into the `sf` object you passed as the second argument to `st_interpolate_aw()`, as a **new column**:

```{r}
#| label: interpolate-as-join
inter_sf <- inter_sf |> mutate(
  interpolated_pop = fully_joined_sf$pop
)
inter_sf
```

And now we can use all the other info, like the name, for the rest of our analysis! For example, when making an interactive map!

```{r}
#| label: interpolated-final
inter_sf <- inter_sf |> mutate(
  krd_name = paste0(geounit, ' Kurdistan'),
  pop_str = fmt_pop(interpolated_pop),
  krd_label = paste0(krd_name, ': ', pop_str)
)
mapview(inter_sf, zcol='interpolated_pop', label='krd_label')
```
