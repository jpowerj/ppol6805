I will aim to update the Zoom recording links here as soon as they are available after the end of class. But, in case there's a delay, recordings are **automatically added** to the course's [Panopto page](https://georgetown.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Sessions/List.aspx?folderID=b412a327-e0cd-4897-8401-b1b500239335){target='_blank'}!
