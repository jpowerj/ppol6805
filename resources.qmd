I'm going to try to dump **everything** I used to develop the course materials here---some of it I drew on explicitly (using images from books, for example), and the rest of it seeped into my mind implicitly over the course of preparing the materials. Explore them to see if their different approaches "click" in your mind more than my approach does!

## Textbooks

### Using R

The course's R material is drawn mainly from the following books, where I've tried to put them in order from most-used to least-used (in terms of the slides and assignments!):

* Moraga, Paula (2023). [*Spatial Statistics for Data Science: Theory and Practice with R*](https://www.paulamoraga.com/book-spatial/){target='_blank'} (**Legally free online book!**)
* Pebesma and Bivand (2024). *[Spatial Data Science with Applications in R](https://r-spatial.org/book/){target='_blank'}* (**Legally free online book!**)
* Lovelace, Nowosad, and Muenchow (2024). *[Geocomputation with R](https://r.geocompx.org/preface){target='_blank'}* (**Also a legally free online book!**)

### Using Python

* Rey, Arribas-Bel, and Wolf (2023). *[Geographic Data Science with Python](https://geographicdata.science/book/intro.html){target='_blank'}* (**Yet another legally free online book!**)

## Videos

* For the quickest and most accessible intro to GIS using R I've ever found, you can watch [Sherrie Xie](https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p8649466){target='_blank'}'s R Consortium workshop talk, [*Analyzing Geospatial Data in R*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DD7bXonh-_E){target='_blank'}
* For a high-level overview, that will prepare you well for this course, see [Coursera: Introduction to GIS](https://www.coursera.org/learn/gis/lecture/S0HxB/why-gis-is-awesome){target='_blank'}, which is an online version of UC Davis' Introduction to GIS course.

## Course Materials

* If you're looking to dive headfirst into more intensive statistical modeling of geospatial data, definitely check out [Data Over Space and Time](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/dst/20/){target='_blank'}, a course taught by Cosma Shalizi, a very cool professor of Statistics at Carnegie Mellon University.

## Cartography

* Mark Monmonier, *How to Lie with Maps* (3rd Edition, 2019). \[[EPUB](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/6sb9hzp2ttugi9s6n5bnu/How-to-Lie-with-Maps_Mark-Monmonier.epub?rlkey=wx8yfep9rvhtsyldje5gdzp1t&dl=1){target='_blank'}\]
* Denis Wood, *The Power of Maps* (1992) \[[PDF](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lpu5xsrip7oinir/Denis%20Wood%20%26%20John%20Fels%20-%20The%20power%20of%20maps%20%281992%2C%20The%20Guilford%20Press%29%20-%20libgen.li.pdf?dl=0){target='_blank'}\]
  * I found Chapter 2, *Maps Are Embedded in a History They Help Construct*, especially helpful!
